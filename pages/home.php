                            Belgians (Dutch: Belgen, French: Belges, German: Belgier) are people identified with the Kingdom of Belgium, 
                            a federal state in Western Europe. As Belgium is a multinational state, this connection may be residential, 
                            legal, historical, or cultural rather than ethnic. The majority of Belgians, however, belong to two distinct 
                            ethnic groups or communities (Dutch: gemeenschap or French: communauté) native to the country, i.e. its historical 
                            regions: Flemings in Flanders, who speak Dutch and Walloons in Wallonia who speak French or Walloon. There is also a 
                            substantial Belgian diaspora, which has settled primarily in the United States, Canada, France and Netherlands.

                                Belgium shares borders with France (620 km), Germany (167 km), Luxembourg (148 km) and the Netherlands (450 km). 
                                Its total surface, including water area, is 30,688 km2 (11,849 sq mi). Before 2018, its total area was believed 
                                to be 30,528 km2 (11,787 sq mi). However, when the country's statistics were measured in 2018, a new calculation 
                                method was used. Unlike previous calculations, this one included the area from the coast to the low-water line, 
                                revealing the country to be 160 km2 (62 sq mi) larger in surface area than previously thought.[34][35] Its land area 
                                alone is 30,278 km2.[36][needs update] It lies between latitudes 49°30' and 51°30' N, and longitudes 2°33' and 6°24' E.[37]
                                Belgium has three main geographical regions; the coastal plain in the northwest and the central plateau both 
                                belong to the Anglo-Belgian Basin, and the Ardennes uplands in the southeast to the Hercynian orogenic belt. The Paris 
                                Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine.[38]

                                The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated 
                                by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine (Kempen). The thickly forested 
                                hills and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges. Extending westward into France, 
                                this area is eastwardly connected to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau, on which the Signal de Botrange forms 
                                the country's highest point at 694 m (2,277 ft).[39][40]

                                The climate is maritime temperate with significant precipitation in all seasons (Köppen climate classification: Cfb), like 
                                most of northwest Europe.[41] The average temperature is lowest in January at 3 °C (37.4 °F) and highest in July at 18 °C (64.4 °F). 
                                The average precipitation per month varies between 54 mm (2.1 in) for February and April, to 78 mm (3.1 in) for July.[42] Averages for 
                                the years 2000 to 2006 show daily temperature minimums of 7 °C (44.6 °F) and maximums of 14 °C (57.2 °F) and monthly rainfall of 74 mm 
                                (2.9 in); these are about 1 °C and nearly 10 millimetres above last century's normal values, respectively.[43]

                                Phytogeographically, Belgium is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal 
                                Region within the Boreal Kingdom.[44] According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of Belgium belongs to 
                                the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests.[45] Because of its high population density, industrialization and its location 
                                in the center of Western Europe, Belgium still faces some environmental problems. However, due to consistent efforts by the 
                                various levels of government in Belgium, the state of the environment in Belgium is gradually improving. This led to Belgium 
                                being ranked as one of the top 10 countries (9 out of 132) in terms of environmental protection trends, and to Belgium being 
                                ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection. Belgium moreover has one of Europe's highest waste 
                                recycling rates. In particular, the Flemish region of Belgium has the highest waste diversion rate in Europe. Almost 75 percent 
                                of the residential waste produced there is reused, recycled, or composted.
